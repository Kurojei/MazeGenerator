# MazeGenerator
This project is a maze generator implemented in C++ using the recursive backtracking algorithm. It creates perfect mazes (i.e., mazes with a single unique path between any two points) and outputs them visually to the console.

# Features
- Recursive backtracking algorithm
- Customizable maze dimensions
- Console visualization
- Clean, modular C++ code
- Optional: save/load maze to file (Not finished yet)

# Demo
- Here's an example of a generated maze
